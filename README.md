# Classify-Suspected-Infection

## Language:
R programming

## Platform Used:
RStudio

## Package Used:
Data.table

## Objective:
The primary aim of the "Classify Suspected Infection" project was to leverage medical record data for the identification of hospital patients experiencing severe infections, particularly sepsis. The tasks involved various analyses, including exploring antibiotic data relevant to patient treatment, identifying new antibiotics used based on specific criteria, investigating blood culture data to gain infection insights, and establishing associations between antibiotic and blood culture information. Moreover, the project focused on aligning antibiotic administration and blood culture timing within a specified window, identifying patients receiving intravenous antibiotics within a designated time frame of blood culture, and extracting and analyzing four-day antibiotic sequences to determine presumed serious infections.

## Task:
Identify hospital patients with severe infecton using medical record.

## Insights:
Out of the total hospital patient population under scrutiny, a concerning 14.94% of individuals meet the established criteria indicative of severe infection or suspected sepsis. This insight highlights the substantial portion of patients whose medical records suggest the presence of conditions that align with the dangerous trajectory of sepsis. Recognizing and addressing these cases early through the analysis of specific markers or indicators within their medical records is vital. Swift identification enables timely medical interventions and appropriate care, potentially mitigating the progression of sepsis and significantly improving the patients' chances of recovery. Therefore, the focus remains on efficiently identifying these cases based on medical records to provide immediate and targeted medical care to those at risk of or affected by sepsis, ultimately saving lives and improving patient outcomes.

## Conclusion:
The project successfully utilized the data.table package in R for extensive data manipulations and analyses, enabling the extraction of critical insights. Through meticulous data filtering, cleaning, and manipulation, the project determined that 14.94% of patients met the criteria for presumed severe infections. The value of statistical calculations, such as computing the mean, was evident in drawing this conclusion. The project showcased the significance of data analysis, specifically within healthcare research, and highlighted the potential to guide healthcare professionals in identifying at-risk patients, ultimately enhancing patient care and safety in hospital settings.

## Future Scope:
The "Classify Suspected Infection" project presents promising opportunities for future research and application in healthcare. By employing advanced analytics and real-time monitoring, this project could significantly enhance infection management, improve patient outcomes, and advance sepsis research. Expanding the analysis to encompass data from various hospitals or healthcare facilities could enrich the dataset, potentially revealing regional variations in infection patterns and treatment practices. This expansion could lead to the identification of more effective ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat infections. The future of this research lies in its potential to impact healthcare positively by allowing early detection and more effective treatment, potentially saving lives. As this research extends to include more comprehensive hospital and patient information, it could significantly contribute to understanding infections better and devising preventive measures, ultimately improving outcomes for patients with severe infections.
